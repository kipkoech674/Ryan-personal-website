    <h3>Technology & Creative Interests</h3>

<p>During my high school years, I developed a strong interest in computers and digital creativity. I enjoyed working with design tools and exploring how technology could be used to communicate ideas visually.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Designed posters for school events and activities</li>
    <li>Created simple digital graphics and layouts</li>
    <li>Applied creativity and attention to detail in visual designs</li>
    <li>Developed basic knowledge of color theory, typography, and layout design</li>
    <li>Used computer software to enhance presentation and communication</li>
</ul>

<p>These early experiences strengthened my creativity, problem-solving skills, and interest in technology, which later influenced my decision to pursue Software Engineering at university.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
    <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>




                                                                                                      
<p>In addition to academics, I actively participated in sports during my secondary school education. I was a member of my school’s football team, where I played as a <b>left back</b>.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Played as a left back for my secondary school football team</li>
    <li>Participated in regular training sessions and inter-school competitions</li>
    <li>Developed teamwork, discipline, leadership, and strategic thinking</li>
</ul>

<p>Balancing academics and sports helped me build time management skills, resilience, and a strong sense of responsibility, which continue to support my academic and personal growth.</p>


<p>I am currently pursuing a <b>Bachelor’s Degree in Software Engineering at Kirinyaga University</b>.</p>

<h3>Key Learning Areas:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Database Management</li>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>System Design</li>
</ul>

<p>University has strengthened my analytical thinking and prepared me for the dynamic tech industry.</p>
